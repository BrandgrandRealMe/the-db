# History of 3D Printing
Early Concepts (1940s-1970s)
----------------------------

The concept of 3D printing emerged long before its practical application:

*   **1945**: Murray Leinster described a similar concept in his short story "Things Pass By."
    
*   **1950**: Raymond F. Jones outlined "molecular spray" in his story "Tools of the Trade."
    
*   **1971**: Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder (U.S. patent 3596285A).
    
*   **1974**: David E. H. Jones discussed 3D printing concepts in a _New Scientist_ column.
    

Invention and Early Development (1980s)
---------------------------------------

The 1980s marked the birth of modern 3D printing:

*   **1980**: Dr. Hideo Kodama filed a patent (JP S56-144478) for a rapid prototyping machine using UV light to polymerize resin, laying the groundwork for stereolithography (SLA).
    
*   Bill Masters filed the first 3D printing patent (US 4665492) on July 2, focusing on computer-automated manufacturing. Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte, and Jean Claude André filed a patent for SLA on July 16, but it was abandoned.Chuck Hull filed a patent for SLA on August 8, granted in 1986, and created the .stl file format, earning him the title "inventor of 3D printing."
    
*   **1986**: Hull founded 3D Systems Corporation, commercializing SLA technology.
    
*   **1987**: 3D Systems released the SLA-1, the first commercial 3D printer.
    
*   **1988**: Carl Deckard patented Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) at the University of Texas.
    
*   **1988**: Scott Crump developed Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and founded Stratasys.
    
*   **1989**: Stratasys released the first FDM printer.
    

Growth and Expansion (1990s-2000s)
----------------------------------

The industry expanded significantly:

*   **1990**: EOS GmbH was founded, introducing the EOS "Stereos" system.
    
*   **1992**: The FDM patent was issued to Stratasys.
    
*   **1993**: Solidscape (formerly Sanders Prototype) was established, focusing on inkjet 3D printing.
    
*   **1995**: Z Corporation licensed binder jetting technology from MIT.
    
*   **1999**: Advances enabled the creation of engineered organs, expanding medical applications.
    
*   **2000**: The first 3D printed kidney was created.
    
*   **2004**: Dr. Adrian Bowyer initiated the RepRap Project, aiming to create self-replicating 3D printers.
    
*   **2005**: ZCorp launched the Spectrum Z510, the first high-definition color 3D printer.
    
*   **2008**: The first 3D printed prosthetic limb was produced.
    
*   **2009**: FDM patents entered the public domain, spurring affordable consumer printers.
    

Mainstream Adoption and Advancements (2010s-2020s)
--------------------------------------------------

3D printing became widely accessible:

*   **2010**: The Urbee, the first 3D printed car prototype, was unveiled.
    
*   **2011**: Cornell University began developing 3D food printers.
    
*   **2012**: The first 3D printed prosthetic jaw was implanted.
    
*   **2013**: President Obama highlighted 3D printing in his State of the Union address.
    
*   **2015**: Carbon 3D introduced the CLIP (Continuous Liquid Interface Production) printer for faster printing.
    
*   **2016**: Daniel Kelly’s lab created 3D printed bone.
    
*   **2018**: The first family moved into a 3D printed house (1022 sq ft, printed in 2 days).
    
*   **2020s**: Advanced materials like Ultrasint® PA11 ESD and TPU01 were introduced for demanding applications.
