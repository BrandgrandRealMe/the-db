# 3D Printing Materials
3D printing uses a variety of materials, including plastics, metals, and ceramics, each chosen based on desired properties like strength, flexibility, or heat resistance. The evidence leans toward plastics being the most common due to their versatility and affordability, while metals and ceramics cater to specialized applications.

Properties
----------

Material Type | Examples | Properties
-------------- | -------- | ---------------
**Plastics** | ABS, PLA, Nylon, TPU, PETG | Thermoplastics: Reusable, flexible; Thermosets: Brittle, heat-resistant
**Metals** | Stainless Steel, Titanium, Aluminum | High strength, corrosion/heat resistance
**Ceramics** | Alumina, Zirconia, Silicon Nitride | High temperature resistance, biocompatibility
