# OptiCore Terms of Service

Last Updated: June 12, 2025

By using OptiCore (the "Bot"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("ToS"). If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the Bot.

## 1. General Usage
- **Purpose**: OptiCore is a Discord bot designed to provide server management, engagement, and utility features, including giveaways, polls, moderation tools, reminders, to-do lists, and AI-generated images.
- **Access**: The Bot is provided free of charge to Discord servers with appropriate permissions. Some features (e.g., moderation commands) require specific Discord permissions (`Manage Messages`, `Ban Members`, `Kick Members`).
- **Availability**: The Bot is provided "as is" with no guarantee of uptime or availability. The Bot owner may update, modify, or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice.

## 2. User Conduct
- **Appropriate Use**: You agree to use the Bot in compliance with Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Prohibited actions include:
  - Using the Bot to send spam, malicious content, or content that violates Discord's policies.
  - Attempting to exploit, hack, or bypass the Bot's functionality.
  - Using the Bot to harass or harm other users.
- **Command Usage**: Commands like `/ban`, `/kick`, and `/clear` are restricted to users with appropriate server permissions. Misuse of these commands may result in removal of the Bot from your server.
- **AI Image Generation**: The `/ai generateimage` command must not be used to generate inappropriate, offensive, or illegal content. Generated images are logged with user IDs and prompts for moderation purposes.

## 3. Data Collection and Usage
- **Data Storage**: The Bot stores data such as user IDs, giveaway entries, poll votes, reminders, and to-do tasks in SQLite databases to provide its features. See the [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) for details.
- **Responsibility**: Server administrators are responsible for ensuring users are aware of the Bot's data collection practices before inviting it to their server.

## 4. Intellectual Property
- **Bot Content**: OptiCore, including its code, logo, and assets, is licensed under the MIT License. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works without permission, except as allowed under the license.
- **User-Generated Content**: Content submitted via commands (e.g., suggestions, poll questions, giveaway prizes) remains the property of the user but may be stored and displayed by the Bot as part of its functionality.

## 5. Limitation of Liability
- The Bot is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. The Bot owner is not liable for any damages, including but not limited to data loss, server disruptions, or issues arising from the use of the Bot.
- The Bot owner is not responsible for the content generated by the `/ai generateimage` command, as it relies on third-party APIs (Herc.ai).

## 6. Termination
- The Bot owner reserves the right to remove the Bot from any server or restrict access to specific users for violating these terms or for any other reason.
- Users may remove the Bot from their server at any time by kicking or banning it.

## 7. Changes to Terms
- These ToS may be updated at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
- Significant changes will be announced in servers where the Bot is active, where feasible.

## 8. Contact
For questions or concerns about these terms, contact the bot owner (Discord ID: 531186390717825074) or use the `/suggestion` command to provide feedback.

By using OptiCore, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
