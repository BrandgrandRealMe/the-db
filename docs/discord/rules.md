# Community Rules  
## Help Us Keep Brandon's DB a Friendly, Focused, and Fun Environment  

Welcome to **Brandon's DB**! To maintain a welcoming and productive space for everyone—developers, makers, and tech enthusiasts alike—please follow these community guidelines.

### 1. 💬 Be Respectful  
Treat every member with kindness, patience, and respect. We have a zero-tolerance policy toward:
- Harassment or hate speech (including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.)
- Bullying, threats, or personal attacks  
- Disruptive behavior meant to provoke or upset others  

Constructive feedback is welcome—hostility is not.

---

### 2. 🔇 No Spamming  
Keep the server clean and focused. Avoid:
- Repetitive or meaningless messages  
- Irrelevant or off-topic content in specialized channels  
- Excessive tagging or use of ALL CAPS  

Help us keep discussions productive and useful.

### 3. 🚫 No Unapproved Advertising  
This is a community space—not a billboard. Do not:
- Promote your server, product, or brand without explicit staff permission  
- Post referral or affiliate links  
- DM members unsolicited promotions or invitations  

If you're unsure, ask a moderator first.

### 4. 📜 Follow Discord's ToS  
You must comply with [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) at all times. Breaking these rules could result in a ban from both our server and Discord itself.

### 5. ❌ Keep It SFW  
This is a safe-for-work server. Do not share, link to, or discuss:
- Pornographic or sexually explicit material  
- Gore, extreme violence, or otherwise disturbing content  
- Inappropriate jokes or content that violates community decency  

NSFW content will result in an immediate warning or ban.

---

### 6. 🛑 No Illegal Activity  
Any discussions or content related to illegal activities—including software piracy, hacking, or drug use—are strictly prohibited.

---

### 7. 🛡️ Respect the Staff  
Our moderators and admins are here to keep the community safe and enjoyable for all. Please:
- Follow their instructions promptly  
- Avoid arguing publicly about moderation decisions  
- Contact staff privately if you have questions or concerns  

Disrespect toward staff may result in disciplinary action.

---

### 8. 🧭 Report, Don’t Engage  
If you witness someone breaking the rules:
- Do **not** confront them directly  
- Use the report feature or notify a staff member discreetly  

We appreciate your help in keeping this community safe.
