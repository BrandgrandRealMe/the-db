version: 1.1.0
title: Version 1.1.0 Release - Moderation & Utility Power-Up!
updateDate: 06-13-2025
---
Welcome to OptiCore v1.1, a major update that introduces powerful moderation and utility commands, built from the ground up to enhance your server experience. Starting with the `/announce` command for seamless updates, we’ve added `/support`, `/links`, and `/feedback` to empower users and moderators alike, all while ironing out kinks for rock-solid performance.

**✨ New Commands**:
- **/announce**: Moderators (with `MANAGE_MESSAGES`) can craft rich announcements using a modal interface, specifying channel, ping (@everyone or roles), title, description, and footer. Perfect for posting updates in `📜»changelog` or other channels.
- **/support**: Get instant help with OptiCore! Access the `❓»help` channel, official documentation, or contact the bot owner (@brandgrandreal) for personalized assistance.
- **/links**: Access key OptiCore resources in one click: [Documentation](https://db.brandgrand.rocks/docs/OptiCore/), [Privacy Policy](https://db.brandgrand.rocks/docs/OptiCore/PrivacyPolicy), [Terms of Service](https://db.brandgrand.rocks/docs/OptiCore/TermsOfService), and [Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/1381801285329883176).
- **/feedback**: Share bugs, feature ideas, or feedback via a sleek dropdown (Bug Report 🐛, Feature Request 💡, General Feedback 🗣️, Compliment ❤️, Complaint) and modal. Submissions land in `💡»suggestions` for team review.

**📢 How to Use**:
- **Moderators**: Use `/announce` to post updates in `📜»changelog` or other channels (requires `MANAGE_MESSAGES`).
- **Users**: Run `/support` or `/links` in `❓»help` or `🛠️»bot-commands` for help or resources. Submit ideas via `/feedback`, viewable in `💡»feedback`.
- All commands use private (ephemeral) replies to keep channels tidy.
